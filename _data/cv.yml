      description:
        - "Research Assistant: We study several facility location problems on various graphs related to uncertain demand data. Specifically, we focus on solving the two-center problem on a line, a tree graph, and a cactus graph, as well as the k-center problem on a general graph. These center problems are classical combinatorial optimization problems and have been explored a lot in theoretical computer science. Our emphasis, however, lies in uncertain demand data, leading us to develop more general algorithmic approaches to address these problems."
